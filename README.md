This File contains several scripts which should aid in the data processing of 
phosphorylation assays performed via NMR.

The Workflow_Phos_Data_Processing.pdf file provides a step by step instruction 
how to process the data in Topspind as well as in the two provided scripts.

The scripts are provided as .py as well as .ipynb and can therefore be processed 
in JupyterNotebook or other python environments.

In addition, a folder with dummy data has been included, the scripts are 
currently in reference to this data. These can be valuable as the script 
can be error prone as it has been trialed with few datasets so far.
